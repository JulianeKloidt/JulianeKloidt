        I have been living in sunny, rainy, and windy Glasgow since 2017,
        gradually falling in love with the country and its people. <br />
        Studying at the University of Glasgow does not only offer me a
        worldclass education but also the opportunity to explore the Scottish
        highlands and islands.
