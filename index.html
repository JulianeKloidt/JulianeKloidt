        Hello everyone, my name is Juliane and I am a final year BSc Psychology student at the Univeristy of Glasgow. <br />
        I am beyond grateful about the fact that I am not only been given the opportunity to study at a worldclass univeristy but also being able to move to sunny, rainy, and windy Glasgow in 2017. Since then, I have been gradually falling in love with Scotland. Scotland has a lot to offer - wonderful people, a rich history, mystical lochs, windy mountains, magnificient islands and tropical-looking beaches. <br />
        With this blog, I would to give back to the country that welcomed me with open arms and show you some of my favourite adventures. I hope that my posts will make you fall in love with Scotland as well and maybe inspire you for future travels. <br />
