    <h1>My Top 5 Travels </h1>
    <h2>1) Wandering around Mallaig's Magnificient Coastline</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p>
      One of my all-time favourite travels was to Mallaig in May 2019. Why? Because you do not need to decide between highlands and islands, beaches or hills - you can get it all in one! 
      The sheer beauty of this trip already started with the six-hour train journey from Glasgow to Mallaig. Taking the "most scenic train route Scotland's" was definitely one of the most beautiful travel routes I ever experienced. The journey flew by as we passed through Scotland's wonderful hill scenery and over the Harry Potter Bridge (Glenfinnan viaduct) towards rocky coastlines and white-sand beaches. Once arrived, a group of friends and myself stayed at the Camusdarach Campsite, just next to one of Scotland's most beautiful beaches. <br />
      The area between the fishing port of Mallaig and Arisaig has a lot to offer. You can either stay on the mainland - wandering from one tropically-looking beach to the next - or visit one of the many islands that lay close by. Take a ferry from Mallaig to the famous Isle of Skye or explore the small isles Eigg, Rum, and Muck departing from Arisaig.

    <h2>4) Embracing the Scottish Summer at Calgary Beach</h2>
</header>
<main>
  <p>
    By now, you might have guessed that I appreciate Scottish beaches. The white sand and the crystal clear, tourquise water make me feel like I am on tropic holidays. Despite their astonishing beauty, the beaches tend not to be crowded and you only need to fight off some seagulls. To me, that sounds even better than some Carribean beach, right? <br />
    The wonderful picture below was taken on Calgary Beach (Isle of Mull) in May 2018.

  <h2>3) Exploring Iconic Skye</h2>
</header>
<main>
    <p>
      What would be a blog about Scottish travel adventures without a post featuring the iconic Isle of Skye? Skye is the largest island of the Inner Hebrides and can be reached by ferry from Mallaig or via the Skye Bridge from Kyle of Lochalsh. Due to it's magical, misty landscape including hills, stone formations, waterfalls and beaches, the Isle of Skye is one of the most popular holiday destinations in Scotland. <br/>
      So far, I have only been to Skye for one weekend - just for long enough to get an idea of its beauty. During my weekend trip, I visited some of Skye's most popular attractions. The Old Man of Storr, Glen Slighachan, the Lealt Waterfalls, and Portree (Skye's capital). Because of its popularity, Skye can get quite crowded with campervans and travel busses. So, if you are looking for remote and peaceful holidays, Skye might not be the best place to go to. Nevertheless, Skye is an astonishing place. I was deeply impressed by its mountains which I would love to hike along during a future trip! <br />
